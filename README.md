This is the README for my resume template, which I modified from the template made by Trey Hunner (http://www.treyhunner.com/). 

Please feel free to change what you like. 

The index.html file is for hosting the pdf resume of the output file online.

The main latex lives in the CV.tex file and can be compiled with pdflatex (and possibly others that I have not tested).

This template requires the resume.cls file to be in the same directory as the
% .tex file. The resume.cls file provides the resume style used for structuring the
% document.
